Hi, I’m Saivarshitha 👋

I’m an Electrical Engineering graduate from Rajiv Gandhi University Of Knowledge Technologies, Basar and I’m currently learning and building my skills as a Data Analyst. I enjoy working with data, understanding patterns, and turning raw data into meaningful insights that can help in decision-making.

I started my journey with data analysis during my graduation, where I worked on multiple academic and practical projects. Since then, I’ve been improving my skills in SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI by practicing on real datasets and building small proj

### Skills I’m Working With
- SQL (queries, joins, subqueries)
- Python (Pandas, basic data analysis)
- Excel (data cleaning, formulas)
- Power BI (basic dashboards and reports)

### Projects
- Library Management System using SQL  
- Exploratory Data Analysis using Python  
- Sales / Business Dashboard using Power BI  

I’m actively adding more projects and improving my GitHub profile as I learn.


Thanks for visiting my profile 🙂
